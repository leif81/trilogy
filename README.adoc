= Trilogy

== About

Back before Netflix, and when I-Tunes coverflow was new and cool, I thought it'd be neat to have something similar for browsing a collection of movie files by swiping through a list of dvd covers.

== Requirements
	
* clutter 0.4

== Build it

 $ cd src
 $ make

== Run it

 $ ./trilogy
